<h2>About</h2>

<div id="content">
	<p><a href="/">scheibo.com</a> is Kirk Scheibelhut's <span id="phonetic">/shy-bell-hut/</span> blog dedicated to programming and technology. It is the sister site to <a href="http://kirkscheibelhut.com">kirkscheibelhut.com</a> which is more of a personal blog with a bias towards athletic endeavours.</p>

<p>There is no commenting system enabled on the blog - partly to avoid dealing with spam but mainly to avoid flames and thus allow myself to indulge the belief that people enjoy my site. If you wish to comment, see the <a href="/contact">contact</a> page for how to reach me.</p>

<p>This site is built on a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, more specifically <a href="https://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext">jekyll_ext</a>. The backend relies on the extensions found in <a href="https://github.com/rfelix">rfelix's</a> <a href="https://github.com/rfelix/my_jekyll_extensions">my_jekyll_extensions</a>, and the front end is heavily 'inspired' (stolen) by Jeff Kreeftmeijer's beautiful site, <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/">jeffkreeftmeijer.com</a>. The background image was found on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jliba/">Josh Liba's</a> Flickr, and is licensed under Creative Commons.</p>

<p>The site was built after a sort of 'meta-analysis' of the various sites posted on Jekyll's <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">Sites</a> page. The result of this work has been extracted to <a href="https://github.com/scheibo/static">static</a>, the skeleton of my blogs. It features some nice extensions and rake tasks that make designing a Jekyll site easy... especially if you hope to make a Jekyll site that looks exactly like this. As Pablo Picasso said, <quote>"Good artists copy, great artists steal."</quote>

<p>I regularly read Hacker News and Reddit, and can be found in various places throughout the internets, always under the handle of <tt>scheibo</tt>. The litmus test for whether an account on the web belongs to myself is if it has the 'unicorn and rainbow' image as its avatar:</p>
